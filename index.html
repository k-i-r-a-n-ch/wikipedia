    <p >Game of Thrones is an  <i>American fantasy drama television series</i> created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, 
        a series of fantasy novels by George R. R. Martin, the first of which is A <mark>Game of Thrones.</mark> The show premiered on HBO in the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr>
         on April 17, 2011, and concluded on <del>May 19, 2019</del><ins>May 27, 2019</ins> with 73 episodes broadcast over eight seasons.</p>
    <p><b>Game of Thrones</b> is roughly based on the storylines of the A Song of Ice and Fire book series by 
        George R. R. Martin, set in the fictional <small>Seven Kingdoms of Westeros</small> and the continent of Essos. The series follows 
        several simultaneous plot lines The first story arc follows a war of succession among competing claimants for control of 
        the <em>Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms,</em> with other noble families<sub>20</sub> fighting for independence from the throne. The second concerns 
        the exiled scion's actions to reclaim the throne; the third chronicles the threat of the impending winter, as well as the legendary 
        creatures and fierce peoples of the North.</p>

        <p >The first season's southern scenes were filmed in Malta, a change in location from the pilot 
            episode's Moroccan sets. The city of Mdina was used for King's Landing. <mark>Filming also took place at Fort Manoel</mark> 
            (representing the Sept of Baelor); at the Azure Window on the island of Gozo (the Dothraki wedding site); and at San Anton 
            Palace, Fort Ricasoli, Fort St. Angelo and St. Dominic monastery <del>(all used for scenes in the Red Keep).</del> Filming of the 
            second season's <sup>[1]</sup>southern scenes shifted from Malta to Croatia, where the city of Dubrovnik and nearby locations allowed exterior 
            shots of a walled, coastal medieval city. The Walls of Dubrovnik and <del>Fort Lovrijenac were used for scenes in King's</del> Landing, 
            though exteriors of some local buildings in the series, for example, the Red Keep and the Sept of Baelor, are computer generated.
             The island of Lokrum, the St. Dominic monastery in the coastal town of Trogir, the Rector's Palace in Dubrovnik, and the 
            Dubac quarry (a few kilometers east) were used for scenes set in Qarth. Scenes set north of the Wall, in the Frostfangs, and at 
            the Fist of the First Men, were filmed in November 2011 in Iceland on the Vatnajökull glacier near Smyrlabjörg, the 
            Svínafellsjökull glacier near Skaftafell, <del>and the Mýrdalsjökull glacier near Vik on Höfðabrekkuheiði.</del> Filming 
            also occurred at the harbor in Ballintoy, Northern Ireland.</p>
